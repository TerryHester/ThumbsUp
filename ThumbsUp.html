                  <p>Thumbs Up is a fun word game for everyone. The game can be played by one person or many.<p
                
                For group play, each player will take a turn at building their own sentence. To begin, click on the 'Deal My Hand" button. Now you have the words that you will use to make your sentence. <p> 
                
                You build your sentence(s) by clicking on the words in your hand that you wish to use to form your sentence.
                
                You may make changes to any of the words in your sentence by clicking on the words you which to replace or alter the ending of, and then choosing a replacement word or ending from the list that appears below. Altering an ending may result in some spelling problems. For example "run" becomes "runing". The "n" is not doubled. But that's okay. Remember, it's a game not a grammar quiz!. <p>
                
                Once the player is satisfied with his or her sentence, it is up to the other contestants to decide if it is a valid sentence. A sentence is not judged on the bases of whether or not it makes perfect sense in the real world. It is valid if it makes sense under any circumstances; even the most crazy circumstances. As long as verbs are used as verbs, nouns as nouns, etc. then the sentence is good.
                
                The rest of the players are then asked, "Is this a valid sentence?" If at least half of the group gives a "Thumbs Up" sign, then the sentence is accepted. <p> Points are calculated in the following way: One point for the first word, two points are added to the current points for the second word (so a two word sentence would be 3 points), and so forth.<p>
                 
                Awards can be given for the most logical sentence(s), the strangest sentence, the most unique sentence or the funniest sentence. Remember, it's all about having fun.</p>
